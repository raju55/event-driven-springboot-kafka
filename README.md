## Event-Driven Architecture Overview
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dfd16e0-61fa-4fd9-b7f4-a05d588dc827)


- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** is a design approach where events are used to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.
- **Common in Modern Applications:** EDA is frequently used in modern applications, especially those built with microservices.
- **Definition of an Event:**
  - An event represents a change in state or an update within the system.
  - Examples include actions like placing an item in a shopping cart on an e-commerce website.
- **Event Details:**
  - Events can carry state information (e.g., item purchased, price, delivery address).
  - Alternatively, events can serve as identifiers (e.g., a notification that an order was shipped).

### Key Components of Event-Driven Architecture

1. **Event Producers:**
   - These are services that publish events when a significant change or action occurs.
   
2. **Event Routers:**
   - The router filters and directs events from producers to the appropriate consumers.
   
3. **Event Consumers:**
   - Consumers are services that receive and process events, taking action based on the event data.

### Benefits of Decoupling in EDA

  - **Decoupled Services:** Producer and consumer services are independent, allowing them to be:
  - **Scaled:** Services can be scaled independently based on demand.
  - **Updated:** Updates can be applied to individual services without affecting others.
  - **Deployed:** Services can be deployed separately, improving deployment flexibility and reducing downtime.

    
 ## Advantages of Event-Driven Architecture

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) offers several key advantages that enhance the performance, scalability, and maintainability of software systems. By leveraging EDA, this project benefits from the following advantages:

1. **Loose Coupling:**
   - **Advantage:** Components in an event-driven system communicate through events without needing to know about each other directly. This reduces dependencies and allows for greater flexibility in how components are developed and maintained.

2. **Scalability:**
   - **Advantage:** EDA enables horizontal scaling by allowing events to be processed in parallel across multiple consumers. This architecture is ideal for systems that need to handle high loads or large volumes of data.

3. **Real-Time Processing:**
   - **Advantage:** Events are processed as they occur, enabling the system to react immediately to changes or new information. This is particularly useful in applications where timely responses are critical.

4. **Flexibility and Extensibility:**
   - **Advantage:** New features can be added easily by introducing new event producers or consumers without disrupting the existing system. This makes the architecture highly adaptable to changing requirements.

5. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance:**
   - **Advantage:** In an event-driven system, components operate independently. If one component fails, the others can continue to function, and events can be queued for later processing. This enhances the overall resilience of the system.

6. **Improved Maintainability:**
   - **Advantage:** The modular nature of EDA simplifies maintenance and troubleshooting. Individual components can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system, making it easier to manage and evolve the application.

By incorporating these advantages, the Event-Driven Architecture used in this project ensures that the system is robust, scalable, and responsive to real-time events, making it well-suited for modern, dynamic applications.

1. **Java:**
   - The core programming language used to build the microservices that produce and consume events.
   - Provides robust libraries and frameworks to support EDA design patterns.

2. **Kafka:**
   - Serves as the event streaming platform that facilitates communication between decoupled services.
   - Handles the distribution, buffering, and persistence of events across the system.

3. **Spring Boot:**
   - A powerful framework that simplifies the development of Java-based microservices.
   - Integrates seamlessly with Kafka to build scalable and event-driven applications.

4. **Docker:**
   - Containerization technology used to package and deploy the microservices in isolated environments.
   - Ensures consistent behavior across different environments, making deployment easier and more reliable.

5. **Akhq:**
   - A web UI tool for managing and monitoring Kafka clusters.
   - Provides insights into Kafka topics, partitions, consumers, and producers, helping to manage the event-driven system effectively.

This implementation combines these technologies to create a flexible, scalable, and maintainable event-driven architecture. The system is composed of microservices that interact through Kafka events, leveraging Spring Boot for development and Docker for deployment, with Akhq providing monitoring and management capabilities.

# Apache Kafka Overview

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that is widely used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Originally developed by LinkedIn, Kafka was later open-sourced through the Apache Software Foundation. Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency data streams in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner.

## Key Features of Apache Kafka

- **Distributed System**: 
  - Kafka operates as a distributed system across multiple servers (brokers), allowing it to scale horizontally and provide high availability.

- **Publish-Subscribe Messaging**: 
  - Kafka uses a publish-subscribe model where producers send messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to these topics to receive messages.

- **Scalability**:
  - Topics are partitioned, allowing Kafka to distribute data across multiple brokers, enabling the system to scale and handle high volumes of data.

- **Durability**:
  - Kafka ensures data durability by replicating partitions across multiple brokers, safeguarding against data loss in case of failures.

- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Kafka’s distributed architecture and replication mechanisms make it resilient to broker failures, ensuring continued operation without data loss.

- **High Throughput and Low Latency**:
  - Kafka is optimized for high throughput and low latency, making it ideal for processing large streams of data in real-time.

- **Stream Processing**:
  - Kafka Streams API allows for real-time processing of data, supporting complex event processing and transformation directly within Kafka.

- **Decoupling of Producers and Consumers**:
  - Kafka decouples producers from consumers, allowing them to operate independently, which simplifies scaling and system maintenance.

- **Real-Time Data Integration**:
  - Kafka can integrate real-time data from various sources and deliver it to multiple destinations, making it a key component in real-time data pipelines.

- **Exactly-Once Semantics**:
  - Kafka provides exactly-once semantics (EOS), ensuring that each message is processed exactly once, even in distributed and fault-tolerant environments.

- **Flexible and Simple APIs**:
  - Kafka offers flexible APIs for producers, consumers, connectors, and stream processing, making it easy to integrate with various applications and systems.

## Use Cases for Apache Kafka

- **Real-Time Data Pipelines**: 
  - Kafka is used to build pipelines that transport data in real-time from one system to another.
  
- **Stream Processing**:
  - Kafka can be integrated with stream processing frameworks like Apache Flink, Apache Storm, or Kafka Streams for real-time data processing.

- **Log Aggregation**:
  - Kafka aggregates logs from multiple services and stores them in a centralized location for analysis.

- **Event Sourcing**:
  - Kafka is used in event-driven architectures to store and distribute events in a scalable and reliable manner.

- **Messaging**:
  - Kafka acts as a message broker, enabling asynchronous communication between distributed systems.

## Conclusion

Apache Kafka is a powerful platform for building real-time, event-driven applications that require reliable, scalable, and high-performance data streaming capabilities. Its core features, including scalability, fault tolerance, and stream processing, make it an ideal choice for a wide range of use cases in modern data architectures.

# Apache Kafka Architecture

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that provides a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. Kafka's architecture is designed for scalability, fault tolerance, and durability, making it an ideal choice for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

## Key Components of Kafka Architecture
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34d57d90-2ce0-447b-938b-1edca58202d4)

1. **Topics**
   - Topics are where data is published.
   - Topics are the logical channels in Kafka where records (messages) are published.
   - Topics are partitioned, meaning they are divided into multiple segments or partitions for scalability and parallel processing.
   - Each message in a topic is assigned a unique offset, which identifies the position of the message within a partition


2. **Partitions**
   - Partitions are the segments that divide a Kafka topic into smaller, manageable pieces.
   - Each partition contains an ordered, immutable sequence of records, where every record is identified by a unique sequential ID called an offset.
   - Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers (brokers) in a Kafka cluster.
   - Consumers can read from different partitions simultaneously, enabling parallel processing and improving data throughput.
   - Kafka guarantees the order of messages within a single partition, ensuring that messages are processed in the order they were received.
   - Kafka does not guarantee message ordering across multiple partitions within the same topic.


3. **Producers**
     - Producers are the clients that publish records to one or more Kafka topics. Producers write data to Kafka topics by choosing the appropriate partition for each record.
  
    - Producers can send messages to a specific partition or let Kafka decide the partition based on a key or round-robin strategy.
  
    - Producers handle batching, compression, and retries to optimize throughput and reliability.


4. **Consumers**
     - Consumers are the clients that read records from Kafka topics. They subscribe to one or more topics and process the messages they receive.

    - Consumers are grouped into consumer groups. Each consumer in a group reads from a unique set of partitions, ensuring that each message is processed only once by the group.

    - Kafka tracks the offset of messages read by each consumer, allowing consumers to resume from where they left off.


5. **Brokers**
    - Brokers are the Kafka servers that store data and serve client requests (producers and consumers).

    - A Kafka cluster is made up of multiple brokers, and each broker is responsible for storing a portion of the topic partitions.

    - Brokers coordinate with each other to maintain data replication, manage leadership for partitions, and handle client requests.

    - Kafka brokers are designed to scale horizontally, allowing clusters to handle massive amounts of data.


6. **Leader and Followers**
   - Each partition has one broker designated as the leader and one or more brokers designated as followers. The leader broker handles all read and write requests for the partition, while followers replicate the data from the leader.
   - If the leader broker fails, Kafka automatically elects one of the followers as the new leader, ensuring high availability.

7. **Replication**
   - Kafka replicates each partition across multiple brokers to ensure data durability and fault tolerance. The replication factor is configurable per topic.
   - Replication ensures that even if a broker fails, the data remains available in the cluster.

8. **ZooKeeper (in legacy setups)**
   - Traditionally, Kafka used Apache ZooKeeper for distributed coordination, including managing metadata, leader election, and service discovery.
   - In recent versions, Kafka introduced KRaft mode, which removes the dependency on ZooKeeper by handling these functions internally within Kafka itself.

9. **KRaft Mode (Kafka Raft)**
   - KRaft mode is an internal consensus protocol introduced in recent Kafka versions to manage metadata and leader election without relying on ZooKeeper.
   - KRaft mode simplifies Kafka's architecture by consolidating these responsibilities within Kafka, making the system more efficient and easier to manage.

10. **Producers and Consumers API**
    - Kafka provides robust APIs for producers and consumers, allowing developers to easily integrate Kafka with their applications.
    - The producer API allows for sending messages to Kafka topics, while the consumer API provides functionalities for subscribing to topics, managing offsets, and handling message consumption.

11. **Kafka Streams**
    - Kafka Streams is a stream processing library built on top of Kafka, allowing developers to build real-time applications that process data directly within Kafka.
    - Kafka Streams supports operations like filtering, aggregating, joining, and windowing, enabling complex stream processing workflows.
   
12. **Cluster**
     - A Kafka cluster is a collection of brokers that work together to manage topics and partitions, store data, and serve client requests.
    - Clusters provide high availability and fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple brokers.
    - Kafka clusters can be scaled by adding more brokers, which automatically balances the load across the cluster.


## Data Flow in Kafka


1. **Producers send messages to topics**:
   - Producers publish messages to a specific topic. The messages are distributed to the appropriate partition within the topic based on the key provided (or using round-robin if no key is specified).
   - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2c8dfa1-9d59-4f94-849a-a063de8d71f2)


2. **Kafka brokers handle storage and replication**:
   - The leader broker for each partition writes the messages to disk and replicates them to follower brokers based on the replication factor.

3. **Consumers read messages from topics**:
   - Consumers subscribe to topics and read messages from the partitions assigned to them. Kafka tracks the offset of each message, allowing consumers to resume reading from where they left off.
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/543f1c7a-797c-411b-a82a-1261e11970fd)

4. **ZooKeeper (or KRaft mode) manages cluster coordination**:
   - In legacy setups, ZooKeeper manages leader elections and metadata. In KRaft mode, Kafka itself handles these tasks, streamlining the architecture.

## Summary

Kafka's architecture is designed to be distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant. With its partitioned and replicated model, Kafka can handle high-throughput and low-latency data streams, making it ideal for a wide range of real-time data processing applications. Whether used for messaging, log aggregation, or stream processing, Kafka's architecture provides the foundation for building robust and scalable data-driven systems.

# Kafka Topic Management Guide

This guide provides essential commands for managing Kafka topics using `kafka-topics.sh`. It includes instructions on how to create, list, describe, and delete topics, as well as how to configure partitions and replication factors. We assume that the directory containing `kafka-topics.sh` is included in your system's `PATH`.

## Commands and Explanations
          1. Create a Kafka Topic
             To create a new Kafka topic named `hello-world`, use the following command:
             kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic hello-world --create
          2.List All Topics
             kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
           3. Describe a Topic
              kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic hello-world --describe
           4. Delete a Topic
              kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic hello-world --delete
           5. Create a Topic with Partitions
              kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic order-events --create --partitions 2
           6. Create a Topic with Replication Factor
              kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic order-events --create --replication-factor 3
           7. Create a Topic with Partitions and Replication Factor
             kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic order-events --create --partitions 2 --replication-factor 3




# Kafka Console Producer Guide

This guide provides basic commands for using the `kafka-console-producer.sh` script to send messages to a Kafka topic. The examples assume that the directory containing `kafka-console-producer.sh` is included in your system's `PATH`.

## Commands and Explanations

### 1. Produce Messages to a Kafka Topic

    To start a Kafka console producer that sends messages to the `hello-world` topic, use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic hello-world
    
   # Produce Messages with a linger.ms Configuration -
    kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic hello-world --producer-property linger.ms=100
    
    To configure the producer to wait for up to a specified time before sending messages (allowing more messages to batch together), you can use the linger.ms setting:
    The linger.ms setting configures the producer to wait up to 100 milliseconds before sending the messages.
    This can increase throughput by batching multiple messages together, reducing the number of requests sent to the broker.
    The --producer-property option allows you to specify additional configuration properties for the producer.
    

# Kafka Console Consumer Guide

This guide provides basic commands for using the `kafka-console-consumer.sh` script to consume messages from a Kafka topic. The examples assume that the directory containing `kafka-console-consumer.sh` is included in your system's `PATH`.

## Commands and Explanations

    ### 1. Consume Messages from a Kafka Topic
    
    To start a Kafka console consumer that reads messages from the `hello-world` topic, use the following command:
    
    ```bash
    kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic hello-world
    
    #Consume Messages from the Beginning of the Topic
    kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic hello-world --from-beginning


# Kafka Console Consumer with Metadata

This guide provides a command for using the `kafka-console-consumer.sh` script to consume messages from a Kafka topic while printing additional metadata such as offsets and timestamps. The examples assume that the directory containing `kafka-console-consumer.sh` is included in your system's `PATH`.

## Command and Explanation

### 1. Consume Messages and Print Offset, Timestamp, etc.

        To start a Kafka console consumer that reads messages from the `hello-world` topic and prints the offset, timestamp, and other metadata, use the following command:
        
        ```bash
        kafka-console-consumer.sh \
            --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
            --topic hello-world \
            --property print.offset=true \
            --property print.timestamp=true
    
            
        The --property print.offset=true option tells the consumer to print the offset of each message. The offset is a unique identifier for each message within its partition and is used to track the position of the consumer.
        The --property print.timestamp=true option prints the timestamp associated with each message, which indicates when the message was produced or appended to the log.
        This command is particularly useful for debugging or monitoring, as it provides insights into the message's metadata along with the actual message content.

# Spring Boot Overview

Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the process of setting up and developing new Spring applications. It aims to minimize the configuration necessary to start a Spring project, allowing developers to get their applications up and running as quickly as possible.

## Key Features of Spring Boot

### 1. Standalone Spring Applications
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that can you can "just run". 

### 2. Embedded Server Support
Spring Boot comes with embedded server options such as Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, eliminating the need for external server deployment.

### 3. Opinionated 'Starter' Dependencies
To simplify dependency management, Spring Boot provides a set of opinionated 'starter' POMs or Gradle builds. These starters cover most of the common use cases, automatically configuring Spring and third-party libraries.

### 4. Automatic Configuration
Spring Boot can automatically configure your application based on the libraries you have added to the project. It avoids much of the boilerplate configuration.

### 5. Production-ready Features
Spring Boot includes non-functional features such as:
- A built-in, configurable embedded server.
- Health checks.
- Metrics.
- Externalized configuration.
- Application and SQL logging.

### 6. No Code Generation and XML Configuration Required
Spring Boot does not require code generation or XML configuration. It offers a purely Java-based configuration option through convenient annotations.

### 7. Microservices-ready
Spring Boot fits well with microservices architecture, thanks to its embeddable server approach and its ability to implement quickly and deploy microservices independently.
